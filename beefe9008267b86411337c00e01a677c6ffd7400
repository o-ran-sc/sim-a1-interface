      "message": "If the remote address has ::ffff in the beginning it means that this is IPV4 address. In python this ::ffff is added to all IPV4 addresses when listening to \"::\", that is both IPV4 and IPV6.(If listening only on IPV4 address, then ofcourse this prefix is not added by python).\nSo for IPV4 address, the \"::ffff\" must be removed to get the remote hostname lookup work. If it is a true IPV6 address then it will not have this prefix, it will be the full IPV6 adress and host name lookup will work if the host name exist. Made the function configurable so an env var need to be actively set to use this feature.",
